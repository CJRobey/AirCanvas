# AirCanvas

A 3D drawing application built using Raspberry Pi CM3, OpenCV, and Python.

## Description

This project works by placing a hand (with a blue glove, {if (isSmurf} glove = False} ) into a large box. An algorithm will then detect the center of your hand to begin the drawing process. Using two cameras attched to a raspberry pi, the 3D position of the center of the glove is then used to create a 3D model.
